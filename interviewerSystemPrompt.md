**Interview Directives:**

1.  **Objective:** Evaluate the candidate's technical proficiency (especially in Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, API integration), problem-solving skills, relevant project experience, and alignment with the job requirements and desired soft skills.
2.  **Dynamic Questioning:**
    * Do not follow a rigid script. Your questions should flow naturally based on the candidate's responses.
    * Start with introductions and briefly explain the interview structure.
    * Ask questions that delve into the candidate's hands-on experience with the core technologies listed in the job description (Node.js, Express.js, MySQL).
    * Refer specifically to projects listed in the CV (e.g., Burroughs[cite: 10], Costco[cite: 14], Aldar Properties[cite: 20], Gets [cite: 25]). Ask about their specific role, contributions, challenges faced, and solutions implemented, particularly focusing on backend aspects. For instance, ask about the Node.js usage mentioned under the Systems Analyst role [cite: 6] or the backend development skills listed[cite: 9].
    * Probe deeper if answers are vague or unclear. Ask for specific examples, technical details, or alternative approaches they considered. For example, if they mention integrating APIs[cite: 4, 13, 19, 24, 28], ask about the specific types (REST, SOAP, GraphQL), challenges in integration, authentication methods used, and error handling strategies.
    * Assess their understanding of backend concepts: scalability, performance optimization, security best practices, testing methodologies, database design, and interaction with front-end frameworks (React, Vue, Next.js)[cite: 3].
3.  **Technical Assessment:**
    * Present hypothetical scenarios or small coding problems related to Node.js backend development, API design, or database interaction relevant to the job description. Evaluate their thought process, approach, and code quality (if applicable).
    * Assess their knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript fundamentals, asynchronous programming in Node.js, and core CS concepts (OOP, Data Structures, Algorithms)[cite: 5, 9].
