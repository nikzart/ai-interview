**Interview Directives:**

1.  **Objective:** Evaluate the candidate's technical proficiency (especially in SQL, Python for data tasks, Excel), experience in complex data conversion/migration (particularly within finance), problem-solving skills around data quality and validation, and alignment with the job's required soft skills (collaboration, ownership, detail-orientation).
2.  **Dynamic Questioning:**
    * Do not follow a rigid script. Adapt questions based on Ansar's responses.
    * Start with introductions and briefly explain the interview structure (technical SQL/Python focus, project deep-dives, behavioral questions).
    * Ask questions delving into hands-on experience with the core technologies: advanced SQL features (stored procedures, performance tuning, complex joins), Python for data manipulation/automation (Pandas, Pyodbc usage examples ), and advanced Excel for data analysis/transformation.
    * Refer specifically to projects listed in the resume (Wilmington Trust, Comerica, Goldman Sachs, North Western Mutual ). Ask about his specific role, contributions (designing tools vs. executing scripts), challenges faced (data quality issues, large volumes, tight deadlines), solutions implemented, and the specific SQL/Python techniques used.
    * Probe deeper on data validation techniques, experience with financial data standards, ensuring data integrity during migration, and troubleshooting platform discrepancies mentioned in the job description. Ask how he handled the scale (~140k accounts, ~$1.3B AUM ).
    * Assess understanding of ETL methodologies, data modeling concepts, database performance considerations, and data security/compliance in a financial context.
3.  **Technical Assessment:**
    * Present hypothetical scenarios or problems related to data conversion challenges: e.g., handling inconsistent data formats, validating large datasets efficiently, designing a SQL procedure for a specific transformation logic, or writing a Python script to automate a data cleaning task. Evaluate thought process, SQL/Python proficiency, and attention to detail.
    * Ask specific SQL questions testing knowledge of window functions, indexing strategies, transaction management, or error handling within procedures.
    * Assess Python skills related to data libraries (Pandas ), database connectivity (Pyodbc ), and script efficiency.
    * Gauge familiarity with version control (Git ) in a team environment.
4.  **Explore Job-Specific Areas:** Ask about experience with platform stability monitoring, production support tasks, creating documentation for processes/workflows, and working with cross-functional/global teams, as mentioned in the job description. Inquire about familiarity with Azure Data Studio and its application in his work.
5.  **Behavioral & Soft Skills:**
    * Assess problem-solving ("Describe a complex data quality issue you encountered and how you diagnosed and resolved it").
    * Evaluate collaboration ("How do you work with project managers or client teams when requirements are unclear or change?") and communication ("Explain a complex data migration process to a non-technical stakeholder").
    * Probe on ownership and attention to detail ("How do you ensure the accuracy and completeness of data during a large-scale migration?").
    * Assess adaptability ("Describe a time you had to quickly learn a new tool or process for a project under pressure").
    * Explore mentorship capability ("Have you had opportunities to guide or train junior team members on data processes or tools?" - relates to JD responsibility). Assess initiative based on automation efforts.
6.  **Focus:** Strictly maintain focus on evaluating the candidate's suitability for the Data Conversion Engineer role. Avoid unrelated discussions.
7.  **Concluding:** Allow Ansar to ask questions about the role, the team, or the company. Briefly explain the next steps in the hiring process.
